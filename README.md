# Website
Working directory for my personal website.

Designed and coded on my MacBook Pro in Bellevue, WA

Built with VS Code.

Code uses [btns](http://mrmrs.io/btns/), [colors](http://clrs.cc/), [lightbox](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/), [smooth scrolling](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/), and [typed](http://www.mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/).

Design is inspired by hundreds of other personal website and the city of Seattle.
