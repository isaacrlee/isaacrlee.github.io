Over the past two years, I have had the opportunity to take a variety of courses in computer science, engineering, and the social sciences. A few of my favorites have been Professor Hartline's **Design & Analysis of Algorithms**, Professor Smutko's **Modern Cosmology**, and Professor Horn's **Human Computer Interaction**.

Student Organizations:

As the Technical Program Director for Northwestern's student branch of IEEE, I lead our technical program for underclassmen. By forming teams led by experienced IEEE members, we guide students through the process of developing their own independent projects.

Additionally, I have helped plan fun events like **[BadHacks](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/news/articles/2016/nu-ieee-hosts-successfully-innovative-badhacks-hackathon-competition.html)**, **[BadHacks II](https://northwesternbusinessreview.org/badhacks-2017-come-for-the-hacking-stay-for-the-chicken-nuggets-1acf9a35bc1b)**, and the **IEEE Project Showcase**.

I have played baseball for nearly my entire life and it has persisted as one of my true passions and favorite hobbies over the years. At Northwestern, I play for our club team as a pitcher and third baseman.
