This summer I am working at <span style="background-color: #39CCCC;">[Rise Science](http://risescience.com)</span> as a Software Engineering Intern. Rise is a sleep-coaching startup that works with athletic organizations to provide personalized sleep guidance and insights gleaned from sensor data.

Sleep has always been of particular interest to me; I have been cataloging my sleep data for years using various iPhone apps and fitness trackers. This interest, as well as my sports and technical backgrounds, drew me to Rise's mission.

At Rise, my main focus is developing new features and repairing bugs in a data dashboard site for sleep coaches. I am iteratively improving the design of the site to improve the speed and efficiency of Rise's sleep coaching process.
