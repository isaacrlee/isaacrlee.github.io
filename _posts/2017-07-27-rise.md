This summer I am working at <span style="background-color: #39CCCC;">[Rise Science](http://risescience.com)</span> as a Software Engineering Intern. Rise is a sleep-coaching startup that works with [athletic](https://www.sporttechie.com/clemson-football-hires-rise-science-improve-team-sleep/) [organizations](https://www.americaninno.com/chicago/meet-the-startup-thats-helping-the-chicago-bulls-get-a-better-nights-sleep/) to provide personalized sleep guidance and insights gleaned from sensor data.

Sleep has always been of particular interest to me; I have been cataloging my sleep data for years using various iPhone apps and fitness trackers. This interest, as well as my sports and technical backgrounds, drew me to Rise's mission.

At Rise, sleep coaches pore through hundreds of data points before reaching out with personalized guidance for each athlete. My main focus was making this process more efficient by iteratively improving a data dashboard site Rise maintains for sleep coaches. I accomplished this by:

* Implementing an instant search interface and a flexible header that dramatically sped up navigation.
* Redesigning and refactoring existing pages to be more intuitive and maintainable
* Developing new API endpoints that allowed sleep coaches to view previously inaccessible data points (e.g. engagement data and raw motion activity)

While the skills I developed using AngularJS, Django, and Pandas are significant, I believe that the experience I gained developing with both technical efficiency and user experience in mind, in addition to the relationships I built with my dedicated coworkers, are what I will truly take away from my time with Rise.
